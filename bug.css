The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, resulting in unexpected behavior.  Specifically, using `calc()` with percentages and other units without proper spacing can lead to parsing errors. For example, `width:calc(50% - 10px)` is correct, while `width:calc(50%-10px)` is incorrect.  Another common error is incorrect nesting of `calc()` expressions.
